\label{ch:initial_checklist}

This chapter focuses on the initial checklist for \neems creation.

\section{NEEM Checklist}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Make sure if tf data is available in correct format 
		\subitem - Check if tf data is provided as individual json documents not as the list/array of json documents.
		\subitem - Check if coordinate system is right handed
		\subitem - Check if correct tf tree is presented in the data
		\subitem - Check if joint rotation is provided in quaternion
		\subitem - Check if position data is logged in meters
		\subitem - etc..
	\item Make sure if triple data is available in correct format 
		\subitem - Check if triple data is provided as an array of json document
		\subitem - Check if correct \soma concepts used from \neemnar part
		\subitem - Validate triple data with \neem validation script??
		\subitem - etc..
		
	\item Check if agent meshes and urdf files are available
	\item Check if agent owl file corresponding to urdf needs to be created
		\subitem - Check if required kinematic information is provided in owl file pointing to correct urdf file name 
	\item Check if environment meshes and urdf files are available
	\item Check if environment owl file corresponding to urdf needs to be created
			\subitem - Check if required kinematic information is provided in owl file pointing to correct urdf file name 
	\item Check if agent and environment meshes with urdf files are rendered properly with \knowrob in rviz 
	\item Check if correct agent and environment meshes are uploaded to \neemhub
	\item Check if correct agent and environment urdf files are uploaded to \neemhub
	\item Test current neem experiment data (tf, triple, meshes and urdfs) locally with \knowrob, \todo{here not everyone will use knowrob, so some way we need to provide an interface}
	
	\item Upload correct tf and triple data to \neemhub?? \todo{this step is a bit unclear, I think we can achieve this two ways, if someone uses knowrob to create neems then they can directly upload neem data to neem hub, second option is via json files directly uploaded to neemhub and REST api endpoints can be created to convert that data, not entirely sure though! Also what about dvc data format that current neemhub supports? how can we from openease side access it?}
